This repo contains a couple of tools to help you work with the reports you get from Coinbase.

**view_report.sh** - create a profit/loss report of your Coinbase crypto account

**send_message.sh** - Sends you SMS messages based on rules you define about crypto currencies

You will need to get API keys from <https://textbelt.com/>
as well as <https://coinmarketcap.com/>

Add the keys as environmental variables:

export TEXTBELT_KEY="your key"

export CMC_PRO_API_KEY="your key"
